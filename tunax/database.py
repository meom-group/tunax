This module the objects that are used in Tunax to describe a :class:`Database` of observations used
for a calibration. By *datas* (:class:`Data`), we refer ton the union of a trajectory and a physical
case which represent a measurment or a reference as a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for example. And
by *observations* (:class:`Obs`), we refer to the union of a trajectory and the Tunax model which
corresponds to it. These classes can be obtained by the prefix :code:`tunax.database.` or directly
