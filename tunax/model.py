Single column forward model core.

This module contains the main class :class:`SingleColumnModel` which is the core of Tunax for
implementing computing the evolution of a water column of the ocean. It also contains functions
that are used in this computation. The model was traduced from Frotran to JAX with the work of
Florian Lemarié and Manolis Perrot [1]_, the translation was done in part using the work of Anthony
Zhou, Linnia Hawkins and Pierre Gentine [2]_. this class and these functions can be obtained by the
prefix :code:`tunax.model.` or directly by :code:`tunax.`.

class SingleColumnModel(eqx.Module):
    r"""
    Single column forward model core.

    This forward model of tunax is the combination of 4 things : the physical case
    :attr:`case_tracable`, an initial state of the water column :attr:`init_state`, the time
    information with :attr:`nt`, :attr:`dt` and :attr:`p_out` and the abstraction of the chosen
    closure for eddy-diffusivity :attr:`closure`. Adding a set of parameters for the closure one can
    run the model with the method :meth:`run`. The builder of this class takes the case as
    arguments all the attributes, except for the case : the parameter is an instance of
    :class:`~case.Case` which is transformed in a :class:`~case.CaseTracable` instance for JAX
    purpose and for the closure : the parameter is only the name of the closure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nt : int
        cf. :attr:`nt`.
    dt : float
        cf. :attr:`dt`.
    p_out : int
        cf. :attr:`p_out`.
    init_state : State
        cf. :attr:`init_state`.
    case : Case
        Physical case and forcings of the experiment.
    closure_name : str
        Name of the chosen closure, must be a key of
        :attr:`~closures_registry.CLOSURES_REGISTRY`, see its documentation
        for the available closures.
    start_time : float, default=0.
        cf. :attr:`start_time`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    nt : int
        Number of integration interations.
    dt : float
        Time-step of integration for every iteration :math:`[\text s]`.
    p_out : int
        Number of of time-steps between every output step.
    init_state : State
        Initial physical state of the water column.
    case_tracable : CaseTracable
        Physical case and forcings of the experiment, made tracable for JAX purposes.
    closure : Closure
        Abstraction representing the chosen closure.
    start_time : float, default=0.
        Value of the starting time in :math:`[\text s]`.
    checkpoint : bool, default=False
        Use the :func:`~jax.checkpoint` on the partial run method. Used for economize the memory
        when computing the gradient, especially on GPUs.

    Note
    ----
    The closure parameters are given only at the end when we compute the model so that the
    calibrations of the parameters are easier.

    Integrate vertical diffusion term for tracers.

    First the flux divergences are computed taking in account the forcings. Then the diffusion
    equation of the tracers system is solved, and the tracers at next time-step are returned. The
    solved equation is for :math:`C` a tracer :

    :math:`\partial _z ( K_m \partial _z C) + \partial _t C + F = 0`

    where :math:`F` is the representation of the forcings. This equation is solved for every tracer
    indicated in :attr:`~case.Case.eos_tracers` and the passive tracer if :attr:`~case.Case.do_pt`
    is set.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    state : State
        State of the water column at the current iteration.
    akt : float :class:`~jax.Array` of shape (nz)+1
        Eddy-diffusivity on the interfaces of the cells
        :math:`\left[\text m ^2 \cdot \text s ^{-1}\right]`.
    dt : float
        Time-step of the integration step.
    case_tracable : CaseTracable
        Physical case which contains the forcings type and values.
    i_time : int
        Index of the time iteration corresponding to the index in the forcing.
    
    Returns
    -------
    state : State
        The state of the water column with the values of the tracers after the integration and the
        diffusion by the eddy-diffusivity.

    Integrate vertical diffusion and Coriolis terms for momentum.

    First the Coriolis term is computed, then the momentum forcings are applied and finally, the

    solved is :
